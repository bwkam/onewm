# OneWM

## THIS IS STILL WIP

- A window manager agnostic framework for configuring UNIX window managers.

- All window managers serve the same purpose, but the problem is that, with the variety of all the window managers out there, it takes time some time to get used to another window manager's configuration language/syntax/options/API. Wouldn't it be nicer to have a single way of configuring bspwm, qtile, and awesomewm? All that by just simply telling your config to use which window manager you want and leave the rest of your configuration as is.

## WMs

- [x] bspwm
